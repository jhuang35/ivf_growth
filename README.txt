#
# R 3.6.1 (2019-07-05) / RStudio 1.2.1335
# All required dependencies are listed at the top of "20210405-Main_Results_Sim_Tables_Figures.R"
# (Typical install time for R and all packages <10 min)
# Stata do-files were tested in Stata 15.1 SE
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# 1. Open "20210405-Main_Results_Sim_Tables_Figures.R" in R/RStudio
# 2. install dependency packages as needed
# 3. replace "~ROOT/" with the appropriate path to the /data/ sub-directory
# 4. all un-commented commands should run correctly; see additional comments in the script file
#
# Analyses scripts are located in /analyses/ sub-directory
# Raw output files are located in the /data/ sub-directory
#
# As described in the main script file, raw original data must be obtained directly from
# GUSTO study team (discuss process with corresponding author), however a simulated dataset 
# preserving the main exposure and covariate relationships, and original covariate values retained.
#
# Main analyses are demonstrated using the "simdata" in the main script file and other analyses
# scripts can be run with some modifications.
# 
# All tables and figures in the manuscript that do not require raw original data can be reproduced
# exactly using the main script and provided output files
